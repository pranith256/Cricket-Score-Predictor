# Cricket-Score-Predictor
This is a Flask-based application used to predict the final score of an innings. The prediction model used is developed using ML algorithms like Linear Regression, multi-regression, and random forest algorithms.

I have developed a Single Page application using Flask Framework.

The parameters used here are no.of overs bowled, no of wickets taken, runs scored in the previous 3 overs, and wickets taken in the previous 3 overs.

The Model built using the Multi-regression models shows exceptional results with 92 accuracy.
